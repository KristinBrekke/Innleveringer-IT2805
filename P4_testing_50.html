your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
well. -->

			<h2>Refleksjon</h2> 
<!--  Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
hear.-->
